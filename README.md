# Arithmetic Formatter

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certification. The Arithmetic Formatter involves creating a function in Python that arranges arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side.

# Project Description

Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. This project requires creating a function that receives a list of strings representing arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. Optionally, the function can display the answers as well.

The function should follow these rules:

- Each operand (number) should only contain digits.
- Each operand has a maximum of four digits in width.
- There should be a single space between the operator and the longest of the two operands.
- Numbers should be right-aligned.
- There should be four spaces between each problem.
- Dashes should be displayed at the bottom of each problem.
  
This project is written in Python.
